## About 
ToDo Buddy - a task management application. 

It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as done. The application uses local storage to persist the to-do list.

## Features
- **Add new tasks:** Users can create new tasks by entering a description and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Edit tasks:** Users can edit the description of existing tasks by clicking on the "Edit" button and modifying the text.
- **Delete tasks:** Users can remove tasks by clicking the delete button.
- **Mark tasks as done:** Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking a check button.
- **Multiple tabs:** Tasks are organized into four tabs: "Active", "Completed", "All", and "Status".

The "Status" tab provides an overview of the current state of the to-do list. It displays the following information:

1. Total tasks: The total number of tasks in the list.
2. Active tasks: The number of tasks that are not marked as completed.
3. Completed tasks: The number of tasks that have been marked as completed.
